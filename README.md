## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS styling
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learned about how to set a content of a page to exact center of the page in regards of width and height.
And also which unit to use on width and height(percentage, and viewport height respectively).
I also learned about box-sizing property in CSS, which I used to full advantage in the project.
The only thing I didn't learn is how to cure my stupidity :p.
